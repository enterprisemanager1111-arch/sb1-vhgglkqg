# User Assigned Events Filter Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced both the home page and calendar page to only display events that are assigned to the current user, providing a personalized view of their schedule.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Home Page Event Filtering**
**File**: `hooks/useTodayEvents.ts`

**Added User Assignment Filter**:
```typescript
// Filter events to only show those assigned to the current user
const userAssignedEvents = eventsWithAssignees.filter(event => {
  const isAssignedToUser = event.assignees && event.assignees.includes(user.id);
  console.log(`ðŸ‘¤ Event "${event.title}" assigned to user:`, isAssignedToUser);
  return isAssignedToUser;
});

console.log('âœ… User assigned events:', userAssignedEvents);
setEvents(userAssignedEvents);
```

### 2. **Calendar Page Event Filtering**
**File**: `hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts`

**Added User Assignment Filter**:
```typescript
// Filter events to only show those assigned to the current user
const userAssignedEvents = eventsWithAssignees.filter(event => {
  const isAssignedToUser = event.assignees && event.assignees.includes(user.id);
  console.log(`ðŸ‘¤ Event "${event.title}" assigned to user:`, isAssignedToUser);
  return isAssignedToUser;
});

console.log('âœ… User assigned events:', userAssignedEvents);
setEvents(userAssignedEvents);
```

## Implementation Details

### **Filtering Logic**
1. **Event Fetching**: Events are fetched with assignee information
2. **User Assignment Check**: Each event is checked if the current user is in the assignees list
3. **Filtering**: Only events assigned to the current user are displayed
4. **Logging**: Clear console logs for debugging assignment status

### **Data Flow**
1. **Fetch Events**: Get all events for the family within date range
2. **Fetch Assignees**: Get assignee IDs for each event
3. **Fetch Profiles**: Get assignee profile information
4. **Filter by User**: Only show events where current user is assigned
5. **Display**: Show filtered events with assignee avatars

### **User Experience**
- **Personalized View**: Users only see events they're assigned to
- **Relevant Information**: No clutter from events they're not involved in
- **Clear Assignment**: Easy to see which events are theirs
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same filtering on both home and calendar pages

## Key Features

### âœ… **Personalized Event Display**
- Only shows events assigned to the current user
- Filters out events they're not involved in
- Provides relevant, personalized schedule

### âœ… **Cross-Platform Consistency**
- Same filtering logic in both home and calendar pages
- Consistent user experience across the app
- Unified event display behavior

### âœ… **Efficient Filtering**
- Client-side filtering after data fetch
- No additional API calls required
- Fast and responsive filtering

### âœ… **Debug Logging**
- Clear console logs for assignment status
- Easy to debug assignment issues
- Transparent filtering process

### âœ… **Maintains Existing Features**
- All existing event display features preserved
- Assignee avatars still work correctly
- Event details and styling unchanged

## Expected Behavior

After this implementation:

1. **Home Page**: "Today on the Calendar" section only shows events assigned to the current user
2. **Calendar Page**: Event cards only display events assigned to the current user
3. **Personalized View**: Users see only their relevant events
4. **No Clutter**: Events they're not assigned to are filtered out
5. **Consistent Experience**: Same filtering behavior across both pages

## Console Logging

You should now see logs like:
```
ðŸ‘¤ Event "Team Meeting" assigned to user: true
ðŸ‘¤ Event "Project Review" assigned to user: false
âœ… User assigned events: [filtered events]
```

## Benefits

### **User Experience**
- **Focused View**: Users see only their relevant events
- **Reduced Clutter**: No unnecessary events displayed
- **Personal Schedule**: Clear view of their commitments
- **Better Organization**: Easier to manage personal schedule

### **Performance**
- **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filtering after data fetch
- **No Extra API Calls**: Uses existing data efficiently
- **Fast Response**: Quick filtering without delays

### **Consistency**
- **Unified Behavior**: Same filtering across all pages
- **Predictable Experience**: Users know what to expect
- **Maintainable Code**: Single filtering logic pattern

The home page and calendar page now provide a personalized view showing only events assigned to the current user!
