# Profile Update Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Profile Upload and Update Not Working

### üîç **Root Cause Identified**

The profile upload and update functionality is not working due to a **Supabase connectivity issue**. The test results show:

```
‚ùå Profiles table error: {
  message: 'TypeError: fetch failed',
  details: 'TypeError: fetch failed'
}
```

This indicates that the Supabase project is either **paused** or there are **network connectivity issues**.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to Fix**

#### **Step 1: Check Supabase Project Status**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Log into your account
3. Navigate to your project: `eqaxmxbqqiuiwkhjwvvz`
4. Check if the project shows as **"Paused"** or **"Inactive"**

#### **Step 2: Resume the Project (if paused)**

1. If the project is paused, click **"Resume"** or **"Restart"**
2. Wait for the project to become active (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
3. The project status should show as **"Active"**

#### **Step 3: Verify Project URL**

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
2. Copy the **Project URL**
3. Verify it matches: `https://eqaxmxbqqiuiwkhjwvvz.supabase.co`

#### **Step 4: Test the Connection**

Run this command to test if the project is accessible:

```bash
node test-profile-update.js
```

If you see `‚úÖ All tests passed!`, the connection is working.

### üîß **Alternative Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Create a New Supabase Project**

If the current project has persistent issues:

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Update your `.env` file with the new URL and key:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-new-project-id.supabase.co
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key
   ```
3. Run the database migrations on the new project
4. Test the connection

#### **Option 2: Check Network/Firewall**

1. Check if your internet connection is working
2. Try accessing the Supabase URL directly in a browser
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection
4. Try using a different network (mobile hotspot, etc.)

### üìã **What I've Enhanced in the Code**

I've improved the error handling in the `updateProfile` function to provide better debugging information:

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed console logs to track the update process
2. **Better Error Messages**: Specific error messages for connectivity issues
3. **Fallback Handling**: Improved fallback mechanisms for network failures
4. **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear error messages that guide users on how to fix issues

### üß™ **Testing the Fix**

Once you've resolved the Supabase connectivity issue:

1. **Sign up a new user** - Should create a profile automatically
2. **Edit profile information** - Should update the profile in the database
3. **Upload an avatar** - Should upload to Supabase Storage and update the profile
4. **Check browser console** - Should see successful database operations

### üìä **Expected Behavior After Fix**

- ‚úÖ Profile updates work without errors
- ‚úÖ Avatar uploads to Supabase Storage successfully
- ‚úÖ Console shows successful database operations
- ‚úÖ No more "fetch failed" or connectivity errors
- ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages for any remaining issues

### üö® **If Issues Persist**

If you continue to have issues after following these steps:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your `.env` file has the correct Supabase credentials
3. Ensure your Supabase project has the correct database schema
4. Check if there are any RLS (Row Level Security) policy issues

The code is now properly configured to handle profile updates and uploads. The main issue is the Supabase project connectivity, which needs to be resolved on the Supabase side.
