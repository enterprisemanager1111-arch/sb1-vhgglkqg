## Storage

### AsyncStorage
- **Key**: `@privacy_settings`
- **Format**: JSON string with 7 boolean values
- **Size**: ~150 bytes (very efficient)

### Backend (Future)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_privacy_settings (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  
  -- Profile Information
  show_profile_photo BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  show_birthday BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  show_email BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  show_phone BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  
  -- Notifications
  task_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  event_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  shopping_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Default Values Philosophy

### Privacy-First Approach
- **Sensitive Information**: OFF by default (email, phone)
- **Public Information**: ON by default (photo, birthday)
- **Notifications**: ON by default (core app features)

### Rationale
1. **Email/Phone OFF**: These are sensitive contact details
2. **Photo/Birthday ON**: Foster family connection
3. **All Notifications ON**: Ensure users don't miss important updates

## Use Cases

### New User Experience
1. Opens privacy settings for first time
2. Sees 7 simple toggles in 2 clear sections
3. Sensitive data already protected (email/phone OFF)
4. Notifications enabled for good experience
5. Can adjust in < 30 seconds

### Privacy-Conscious User
1. Wants minimal sharing
2. Turns off profile photo and birthday
3. Keeps email/phone already OFF
4. Maintains notifications for functionality
5. Done in < 15 seconds

### Social User
1. Wants maximum connection
2. Turns on email and phone
3. Keeps photo and birthday ON
4. All notifications ON
5. Done in < 10 seconds
