# Event Creation Fix Summary

## Problem
The save event function doesn't work after being performed once due to form state management issues.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Form State Not Reset**: After successful event creation, the form state wasn't being reset
2. **Loading State Issues**: Multiple submissions could occur if loading state wasn't properly managed
3. **Modal State Persistence**: Form data persisted between modal opens/closes
4. **No Duplicate Prevention**: No protection against multiple simultaneous submissions

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Form State Reset After Success
```typescript
// Reset form state after successful creation
setForm({
  title: '',
  description: '',
  assignee: [],
  startTime: '',
  duration: '',
});
setLoading(false);
setShowStartTimePicker(false);
setShowDurationPicker(false);
```

### 2. Form Reset on Modal Open
```typescript
// Reset form when modal opens
useEffect(() => {
  if (visible) {
    setForm({
      title: '',
      description: '',
      assignee: [],
      startTime: '',
      duration: '',
    });
    setLoading(false);
    setShowStartTimePicker(false);
    setShowDurationPicker(false);
  }
}, [visible]);
```

### 3. Form Reset on Modal Close
```typescript
const handleClose = () => {
  // Reset form state when closing
  setForm({
    title: '',
    description: '',
    assignee: [],
    startTime: '',
    duration: '',
  });
  setLoading(false);
  setShowStartTimePicker(false);
  setShowDurationPicker(false);
  onClose();
};
```

### 4. Duplicate Submission Prevention
```typescript
const handleCreateEvent = async () => {
  // Prevent multiple submissions
  if (loading) {
    console.log('⚠️ Event creation already in progress, ignoring duplicate call');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of function
};
```

## What This Fixes

### Before:
- ❌ Form data persisted between modal sessions
- ❌ Multiple submissions possible
- ❌ Form state not reset after success
- ❌ Loading state could get stuck

### After:
- ✅ Form resets every time modal opens
- ✅ Form resets after successful creation
- ✅ Form resets when modal closes
- ✅ Duplicate submissions prevented
- ✅ Loading state properly managed

## Expected Result

Now the EventCreationModal should:
- ✅ **Work Consistently**: Function works every time, not just once
- ✅ **Clean State**: Form starts fresh each time
- ✅ **No Duplicates**: Prevents multiple simultaneous submissions
- ✅ **Proper Reset**: All state resets after success or close
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users can create multiple events without issues

## Test the Fix

1. **Open Modal**: Form should be empty
2. **Create Event**: Should work successfully
3. **Close Modal**: Form should reset
4. **Open Modal Again**: Form should be empty and ready for new event
5. **Create Another Event**: Should work consistently

The event creation function should now work reliably every time!
