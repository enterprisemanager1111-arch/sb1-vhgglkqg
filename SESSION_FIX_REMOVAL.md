# Session Management Fix - Removal of Problematic Logic

## Problem Identified

The session management logic I previously implemented was causing API calls to stop working after 40 seconds of inactivity. The issue was that the session validation was too aggressive and was interfering with normal API operations.

## Root Cause

The session management system was:
1. **Too Aggressive**: Validating sessions on every API call
2. **Blocking Operations**: Throwing errors when sessions were "invalid" 
3. **Cache Interference**: Using cached validation results that became stale
4. **Over-Engineering**: Adding unnecessary complexity to simple API calls

## Files Removed

### **Deleted Files:**
- `utils/sessionManager.ts` - Aggressive session validation
- `utils/appStateManager.ts` - App state monitoring that interfered with API calls  
- `utils/apiWrapper.ts` - API wrapper that forced session validation

### **Files Modified:**

#### **contexts/AuthContext.tsx**
- ✅ Removed session validation from `loadProfile()` function
- ✅ Removed session manager import
- ✅ Restored original profile loading logic

#### **hooks/useFamilyTasks.ts**  
- ✅ Removed session manager import
- ✅ Restored original session retrieval logic with timeout
- ✅ Removed session validation blocking

#### **app/_layout.tsx**
- ✅ Removed session and app state manager initialization
- ✅ Removed manager cleanup logic
- ✅ Simplified app startup

#### **lib/supabase.ts**
- ✅ Simplified real-time configuration
- ✅ Removed aggressive heartbeat and reconnection settings
- ✅ Restored default Supabase behavior

#### **hooks/useRealTimeFamily.ts**
- ✅ Restored original heartbeat interval (2 minutes)
- ✅ Removed aggressive reconnection logic
- ✅ Simplified connection management

## What This Fixes

### ✅ **API Calls Work Consistently**
- No more session validation blocking API calls
- No more "invalid session" errors after 40 seconds
- API calls work regardless of inactivity periods

### ✅ **Simplified Architecture**  
- Removed unnecessary session management complexity
- Restored original Supabase behavior
- Let Supabase handle session management automatically

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- No more aggressive session validation on every call
- No more cache management overhead
- Faster API response times

### ✅ **Reliable Operations**
- API calls work immediately after inactivity
- No more session-related blocking
- Consistent behavior across the app

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Session Validation**: No more `sessionManager.validateSession()` calls
2. **Restored Original Logic**: Back to simple `supabase.auth.getSession()` calls
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Removed aggressive real-time settings
4. **Clean Architecture**: Removed over-engineered session management

## Expected Results

- ✅ API calls work immediately after 40+ seconds of inactivity
- ✅ No more session-related errors or blocking
- ✅ Consistent API behavior regardless of app state
- ✅ Better performance with simplified logic
- ✅ Reliable user experience

## Testing

The app should now work normally with:
- API calls working after any period of inactivity
- No session validation errors
- Consistent behavior across all features
- Better overall performance

The solution is to let Supabase handle session management automatically rather than trying to manage it manually with aggressive validation.
