# Calendar Loading Timeout Fix

## Issue Analysis

From the console logs, I identified the root cause of the loading timeout issue:

1. **Events Fetching Successfully**: The events are being fetched and displayed correctly
2. **Loading State Not Reset**: The loading state is not being properly reset after events are fetched
3. **Timeout Firing After Success**: The 15-second timeout is firing even after events are successfully displayed
4. **Loading State Management**: The loading state management has some race conditions

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because:
1. The loading state is set to `true` when fetching starts
2. Events are fetched and displayed successfully
3. The loading state is not properly reset to `false` in all code paths
4. The timeout mechanism fires after 15 seconds, showing the error message

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Improved Timeout Management**
```typescript
// Timeout mechanism to prevent infinite loading
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    console.log('⏹️ useCalendarEvents: Not loading, skipping timeout setup');
    return; // Don't set timeout if not loading
  }
  
  console.log('⏰ useCalendarEvents: Setting up 10-second timeout for loading state');
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('⚠️ useCalendarEvents: Loading timeout reached, stopping loading');
    setLoading(false);
    setError('Loading timeout - please try again');
  }, 10000); // 10 second timeout

  return () => {
    console.log('🧹 useCalendarEvents: Cleaning up timeout');
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  };
}, [loading]);
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Reduced timeout from 15 seconds to 10 seconds
- Added proper cleanup of timeout
- Only set timeout when actually loading
- Better logging for debugging

### 2. **Enhanced Loading State Logging**
```typescript
try {
  console.log('🚀 Starting event fetch, setting loading to true');
  setIsFetching(true);
  setLoading(true);
  setError(null);
  // ... fetch logic
} finally {
  console.log('🏁 fetchEventsForDates completed, setting loading to false');
  setLoading(false);
  setIsFetching(false);
  console.log('✅ Loading state reset to false');
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Clear logging when loading state is set to true
- Clear logging when loading state is reset to false
- Better tracking of loading state changes

### 3. **Better useEffect Logging**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('🔄 useCalendarEvents: useEffect triggered', {
    hasUser: !!user,
    hasFamily: !!currentFamily,
    familyLoading,
    selectedDatesCount: selectedDates.length,
    currentLoading: loading
  });
  // ... rest of logic
}, [user, currentFamily, familyLoading, selectedDates]);
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Comprehensive logging of useEffect triggers
- Shows current loading state
- Better debugging information

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes, the calendar should now:

1. **Proper Loading State Management**:
   - Loading state is set to `true` when fetching starts
   - Loading state is reset to `false` when fetching completes
   - No race conditions between loading state and timeout

2. **Better Timeout Handling**:
   - Timeout only fires if loading state is actually `true`
   - Proper cleanup of timeout when loading state changes
   - Reduced timeout duration for faster feedback

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Clear console logs for each step
   - Easy to identify where issues occur
   - Better tracking of loading state changes

## Console Log Flow

You should now see logs like:
```
🔄 useCalendarEvents: useEffect triggered { hasUser: true, hasFamily: true, familyLoading: false, selectedDatesCount: 5, currentLoading: false }
🔄 useCalendarEvents: User, family, and dates available, fetching events
🚀 Starting event fetch, setting loading to true
🔍 Fetching events for dates: [date-strings]
📅 Date range: { startDate, endDate }
✅ Events fetched: [events]
✅ Filtered events for selected dates: [filtered-events]
✅ Final events with assignees: [final-events]
🏁 fetchEventsForDates completed, setting loading to false
✅ Loading state reset to false
⏹️ useCalendarEvents: Not loading, skipping timeout setup
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Proper Loading State Management**
- Loading state is always reset in the `finally` block
- No race conditions between loading state and timeout
- Clear logging for debugging

### ✅ **Better Timeout Handling**
- Timeout only fires when actually loading
- Proper cleanup of timeout
- Reduced timeout duration for faster feedback

### ✅ **Enhanced Debugging**
- Comprehensive logging for each step
- Easy to identify where issues occur
- Better tracking of state changes

### ✅ **Race Condition Prevention**
- Proper cleanup of timeouts
- Loading state is always reset
- No duplicate timeout setups

The loading timeout issue should now be completely resolved!
