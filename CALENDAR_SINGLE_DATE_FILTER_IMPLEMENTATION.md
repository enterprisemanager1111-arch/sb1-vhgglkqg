# Calendar Single Date Filter Implementation

## Overview
Implemented functionality to filter events by a single selected date in the calendar page. When a user clicks on a date card, it now displays only the events for that specific date.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Single Date Selection State**
- **File**: `app/(tabs)/calendar.tsx`
- **New State**: `selectedSingleDate` to track the currently selected single date
- **Purpose**: Allows filtering events to show only those for the selected date

### 2. **Event Filtering Logic**
```typescript
// Filter events for the selected single date
const filteredEvents = useMemo(() => {
  if (!selectedSingleDate) {
    return calendarEvents; // Show all events if no single date is selected
  }
  
  const selectedDateString = selectedSingleDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  return calendarEvents.filter(event => {
    const eventDate = new Date(event.event_date);
    const eventDateString = eventDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
    return eventDateString === selectedDateString;
  });
}, [calendarEvents, selectedSingleDate]);
```

### 3. **Date Card Selection Enhancement**
```typescript
onPress={() => {
  setSelectedDate(dateString);
  setSelectedSingleDate(date);
  console.log('ðŸ“… Selected single date:', date.toISOString().split('T')[0]);
}}
```

### 4. **Visual Indicators**
- **Selected Date Card**: Green background (`#17f196`)
- **Filtered Date Card**: Green border (`#17f196`) with 2px width
- **Clear Visual Distinction**: Users can see which date is currently selected for filtering

### 5. **Smart Empty State**
```typescript
{selectedSingleDate 
  ? `No events scheduled for ${selectedSingleDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
      day: 'numeric', 
      month: 'long' 
    })}`
  : 'No events scheduled for selected dates'
}
```

### 6. **Show All Events Button**
- **Purpose**: Allows users to return to viewing all events
- **Functionality**: Clears the single date selection
- **Styling**: Green button matching the app's design system

## Implementation Details

### **State Management**
- `selectedSingleDate`: Tracks the currently selected single date for filtering
- `filteredEvents`: Computed property that filters events based on selected date
- Maintains existing `selectedDate` for UI state management

### **Event Filtering Logic**
- **Date Comparison**: Converts both selected date and event dates to ISO date strings
- **Precise Matching**: Only shows events that fall exactly on the selected date
- **Fallback Behavior**: Shows all events when no single date is selected

### **User Experience**
- **Click to Filter**: Click any date card to filter events for that date
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected date card gets a green border
- **Easy Reset**: "Show All Events" button to return to full view
- **Smart Messages**: Context-aware empty state messages

### **Performance Optimization**
- **useMemo**: Efficient filtering that only recalculates when dependencies change
- **Minimal Re-renders**: State changes are optimized to prevent unnecessary renders

## User Flow

1. **Initial State**: All events for the 5-day range are displayed
2. **Date Selection**: User clicks on a specific date card
3. **Event Filtering**: Events are filtered to show only those for the selected date
4. **Visual Feedback**: Selected date card gets a green border
5. **Empty State**: If no events for that date, shows contextual message
6. **Reset Option**: "Show All Events" button to return to full view

## Console Logging

The implementation includes helpful logging:
```
ðŸ“… Selected single date: 2025-10-14
```

## Expected Behavior

- **Date Card Click**: Filters events to show only those for the selected date
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected date card gets a green border
- **Event Display**: Only events for the selected date are shown
- **Empty State**: Contextual message when no events exist for the selected date
- **Reset Functionality**: "Show All Events" button to return to full view
- **Performance**: Smooth filtering without lag or delays

The calendar page now provides a much more focused and user-friendly way to view events for specific dates!
